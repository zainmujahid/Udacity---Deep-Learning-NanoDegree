# Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

## Overview
For this project I was given a dataset of bike sharing patterns, which can be found <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data">here</a>. This data included the following attributes: 

* Duration – Duration of trip
* Start Date – Includes start date and time
* End Date – Includes end date and time
* Start Station – Includes starting station name and number
* End Station – Includes ending station name and number
* Bike Number – Includes ID number of bike used for the trip
* Member Type – Indicates whether user was a "registered" member or a "casual" rider

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a prediction model that took in the above attributes as inputs and predicted the number of bikes hired as an output.
