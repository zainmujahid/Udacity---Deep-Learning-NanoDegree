# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation
This repository contains solutions to my 5 projects related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program. The notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs.

## Honor Code
I am leaving this open source on the honor system. Please do not plagarize my code! You will only learn by investing the time to work through the problems yourself!
