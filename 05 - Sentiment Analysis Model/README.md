# Deployin a Sentiment Analysis Model

## Project Overview
In this project I constructed a Recurrent Neural Network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I deployed the model and constructed a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.
