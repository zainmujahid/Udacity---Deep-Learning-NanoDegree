# Deployin a Sentiment Analysis Model

## Project Overview
In this project I constructed a Recurrent Neural Network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I deployed the model and constructed a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to deploy a RNN based model over AWS SageMaker using public API Gateway.

## Working
The web app takes the user-provided review and predicts if the entered review was POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. The working of the project is shown below:
